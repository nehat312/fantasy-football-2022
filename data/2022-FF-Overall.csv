Taylor also led the NFL in red-zone touches (92), which was not that surprising considering he ranked fifth in that category as a rookie. That elite goal-line usage helped separate Taylor from the pack as the bonafide No. 1 running back in fantasy football. No player came close to sniffing his amount of volume near paydirt. Taylor's 42 carries inside the 10-yard line were 12 more than the next-closest back (Damien Harris, 30). Pairing Taylor's elite red-zone usage with his ascending role as a receiver - 11th in routes run and sixth in route participation in 2021 - makes him worthy of the 1.01 pick across all fantasy formats. No quarterback targeted running backs more than new Colts quarterback Matt Ryan did in 2021 - 8.6 targets per game.",305.97,333.1,1,1,1,1,2,1.1,0,1,1,1,0,

Since 2020 he's dealt with an ankle sprain, thigh injury, AC joint sprain, and high ankle sprain, missing 18 games. When he's on the field, though, he's still a top-three running back. Last season in the five games he played at least 48% of the snaps, he averaged 20.1 (0.5 PPR) fantasy points per game. This would have placed him as the RB3 in weekly fantasy scoring behind only Jonathan Taylor and Derrick Henry.",205.7,90.5,2,4,2.9,2,6,3,0.5,2,4,2.1,0.4,
3,,,RB3,RB,RB,3,1,Derrick Henry,INVINCIBLES,$14 ,F,TEN,6,"Those that faded Derrick Henry as a first-round pick in 2021 received suboptimal results. The Tennessee Titans running back led the position in fantasy PPR points per game (23.4) through eight weeks and bested his 2020 2,000-yard campaign by more than 2.5 PPR points per game. The unicorn running back averaged 29.6 touches per game - seven more than the next closest running back before his injury. And although he didn't play again until the postseason, Henry still finished 15th in the NFL in total touches and as the RB20 overall in just eight games played. No running back better depicts the ‚Äúvolume is king‚Äù mantra better than the King himself and his guaranteed volume make him near bulletproof. Coming off an injury-plagued season does raise some concerns about whether Henry's body is going to break down because of his insane workload. And the lack of pass-game usage is a detriment to his value in PPR formats. But it's impossible to ignore his workload opportunity in 2022 within a Titans anemic passing offense. They don't have any reason to not feature him and there are no indications that they are going to stop with him due $15M this season. Seems more likely than not they ride Henry did his contract expires before the 2024 season when he hits age 30.",259.81,175.3,2,5,4.1,2,8,3.9,0.8,2,6,3.4,0.9,

At 5-foot-10 and 200 pounds, Ekeler finished 8th in the NFL in total touches (276) and 14th in touches per game (17.2). But the raw touches hardly showcase the fantasy value Ekeler possesses, because he often commands an extremely high-share of high-value targets ie. targets and red-zone opportunities. His 13.9% target share and 70 receptions ranked second behind only Najee Harris. Ekeler's 18 red-zone touchdowns and 63 red-zone touches ranked first and second respectively. With such a secure role as a receiver out of the backfield and as a featured red-zone weapon in a high-powered offense, it's hard to imagine a healthy Ekeler not returning at least top-5 fantasy status in 2022.

Over that span, he's gutted out it, though, and only missed four games while dealing with a torn labrum, dislocated shoulder, groin strain, and left shoulder sprain. Despite the injury history, Cook will ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù the load for the Vikings again in 2022. When he was on the field last year, he averaged 21.8 touches and 106.4 total yards per game as the RB11 in weekly fantasy scoring.

The Bengals running back finished the season third in total touches (334) and sixth in touches per game (20.9). Mixon also ranked third in goal-line carries (16) and tied Jonathan Taylor/James Conner in red-zone touchdowns. 2021 was the perfect storm for the fantasy RB3 in half-points scoring coming off a truncated 2020 campaign, and there's reason to believe the positive production will continue in 2022. The Bengals offensive line has been revamped entirely, ensuring that Mixon will be able to repeat his top-10 PFF rushing grade from a season ago. He also flashed upside a receiver down the playoff stretch for the Bengals, averaging nearly six targets per game while running a route on 57% of offensive dropbacks through six games. That route participation would have ranked third among all running backs during the regular season. Mixon fits all the criteria that a fantasy manager would want as a mid-range first round selection in fantasy football. However, he owns the RB7 ADP at 12th overall in early best ball drafts.",222.98,245.9,5,9,6.5,2,12,6.9,1.5,4,11,5.8,1.4,

The Steelers rookie running back managed a league-leading 381 touches in 2021, and finished as the RB4 in half-point scoring as a result. The volume he is going to see in 2022 will ensure he is one of the safest running backs available in fantasy football. Still, the issue with Harris pertains to his true upside potential in an potentially capped offense led by a rookie quarterback. An immobile Ben Roethlisberger was a check-down target machine to Harris in 2021 which may not be the case in 2022. And despite all of his total raw touches, Harris only saw 37 touches (22nd) in the red zone and scored six red-zone touchdowns.",228.39,226.7,6,12,7.9,4,19,8.2,2.3,3,13,8.3,2.3,

Last year he was third in target share (29.2%) and first in air yard share (45.7%) among wide receivers as the WR4 in fantasy points per game.

While a passing game role is a wish that will likely never come true (1.8 targets per game, 2021), Chubb doesn't need it to remain a locked-in top 12-15 fantasy back. His prowess on early downs makes up for the lack of targets. Last year he ranked third in evaded tackles, sixth in breakaway run rate, and fourth in yards per touch last season. As soon as Deshaun Watson is under center, Chubb should see a bump in scoring opportunities. Last season Cleveland ranked 23rd in red-zone scoring attempts per game.",195.43,195.3,6,12,8.9,8,22,11.4,0.8,1,3,1.4,0.8,

Only Deebo Samuel scored more fantasy points above expectation (+74.3) than Chase - a testament to his home-run hitting ability. Chase's 18.0 yards per reception ranked second-best in the NFL behind only Samuel. The Bengals wide receivers' dominance continued in the postseason with back-to-back 100-yard games in the first two rounds of the playoffs.

In the six full games with Jameis Winston under center, he was the RB5 in fantasy, averaging 23.2 touches and 5.5 targets (26.4% target share). Over that span, he was seventh in targets and sixth in receiving yards among all running backs. Kamara is a top 5-10 option at the running back position.",208.46,187.7,7,16,11.2,6,26,13.1,1.1,1,5,3.5,1.1,
13,,,TE1,TE,TE,1,3,Mark Andrews,ROID RAGERS,$4 ,F,BAL,10,"Last year, Mark Andrews was the early-round tight end who drove rosters to fantasy championships. The Baltimore Ravens fourth-year TE led the position with a 25% target share, 28% air yards share and 17.5 fantasy points per game. He ran a route on 84% of offensive dropbacks, which also ranked first. With Marquise Brown traded to the Cardinals, Andrews has solidified himself as clear TE1 with a still unproven second-year wideout as his main competition for targets. However, be aware that even if Andrews does repeat his efforts as TE1 it may not be to the extent that it was in 2021. His 623 routes run were 209 more than he had in 2020 and fueled the career-year. Andrews' increase in route running was tied to the Ravens boosted pass-play rate (56%). From 2019-2020, Baltimore passed on fewer than 46% of their plays. Because Baltimore's increase in passing was due out of necessity in 2021, I'd project it to regress closer to the 2019-2020 rate for this upcoming season.",181.4,194.1,1,2,1.2,11,25,14.8,1,3,8,4,1,

With Joe Judge and Jason Garrett's special brand of season-destroying special sauce gone, Barkley has all the motivation to crush this year as a pending free agent.

He was the RB7, averaging 19 touches and 97.5 total yards per game. While the Lions have added more passing game weapons in the offseason with D.J. Chark and Jameson Williams, Swift's efficiency through the air allows for hope that his target share (18.4%, second among running backs) won't see a drastic dip. In Weeks 1-11, he was ninth in yards per route run (minimum 15 targets, per PFF) among running backs.",179.39,146.9,8,14,10.1,9,27,16.4,1.7,8,17,11.1,2.2,

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end posted his worst points per game average (16.6) dating back to 2017 while also posting a career-low in yards per route run (1.84) and PFF grade (81.8). It seems logical that Kelce's reign as the perennial consensus TE1 has come to a conclusion as he enters his age-33 season in 2022. However, it's impossible to ignore the high-end target share that Kelce will command in the Chiefs offense after they traded Tyreek Hill.

Adams' high level of play won't stop in Las Vegas, but his fantasy stock does get slightly dented going from Rodgers to Derek Carr. It's unlikely that Carr hyper-targets Adams to the length of a 28% target share as Rodgers has done for so many seasons.

His 29% target share fell to 24% as did his yards per route run (2.5 versus 1.8). This resulted in Diggs finishing with just two games with at least 90 receiving yards, a dramatic decrease from his ten 90-plus yard outings during the 2020 regular season. He finished as a top-15 WR just once through the first nine weeks of the season but improved down the stretch as Buffalo's offense hit its stride. He had three top-10 finishes as the WR8 in fantasy points per game in half-point scoring (14.8). Still, top-5 upside still exists with Diggs in this explosive Bills offense even if his target share holds at 24% in 2022. Because his command of high-value targets in the Buffalo offense was unmatched by almost every other WR in the NFL. He was one of just two WRs to hit over 2,000 air yards (Justin Jefferson). Diggs also commanded the most end-zone targets in the NFL (25) during the regular season - six more than the next closest receiver (Justin Jefferson).",193.96,182.5,4,9,5.9,14,24,19,1.2,3,9,6.6,1.5,

The idea of Williams playing a three-down role was salivating, but Gordon's return should not be overlooked after a seriously underrated 2021 campaign. MG3's return definitely hurts Williams' top-tier fantasy ceiling. He's going to split work with another capable back in Gordon which is exactly what new head coach Nathaniel Hackett desires and spoke on at the NFL owners meeting in March. However, keep in mind that Williams finished 13th in touches last season (246, 14.6 per game) and would be the favorite to take another step forward in the passing game - Aaron Jones-esque - after finishing as one of two rookie RBs inside the top-15 in route participation in 2021: Najee Harris (first) and Javonte Williams (13th). Williams falls just out of the fantasy RB1 conversation for me in redraft and best ball, but he's right on the cusp. I don't think he can be ranked worse than RB15 considering that's where he finished as a rookie amid a split workload in a much worse offensive environment.",188.82,161.9,7,16,11.3,10,33,20.1,1.2,4,8,7.1,1.2,

Fournette was also fantastic in the passing game. In that sample, he led all running backs in targets (63) and was fourth in receiving yards (344).

With Davante Adams gone, Jones could save his fantasy scoring with a heavier target load. Since 2019 in the seven games Jones has played without Adams on the field, he's seen his targets bump from 3.9 per game to 6.7. His receiving yardage also increased from 21.6 to 55.4 per game.

Hill's aDOT also dipped dramatically to 10.6, which was the lowest it's been since his rookie season. And It's undeniable that going from Patrick Mahomes to Tua Tagovailoa is a massive downgrade for Hill. Tagovailoa has yet to show that he can properly fuel a fantasy WR1, so it's hard to expect Hill to deliver a top-5 season with a lesser passer. Especially with Tagovailoa's lack of a confident deep ball, a prominent running game, and Jaylen Waddle also heavily involved in the offensive game plan.

Elliott has amassed 1,938 touches (22 per game) over his six-year career, never handling less than 268 touches in any season.

Injuries to the back-ups boosted Jacobs' role as a receiver slightly, but it was not the only cause. There was a deliberate effort to feature Jacobs more as a receiver with him catching at least two passes in 12 of his 15 games played. And more importantly, the receiving capability that Jacobs displayed puts to rest the narrative that he is ‚Äúgame-script‚Äù dependent. Whether the Raiders are winning or losing in a loaded 2022 AFC West, JJ has proven he can be used in all facets. Now the Raiders did elect to sign both Brandon Bolden and Ameer Abdullah this offseason to bolster their running back stable behind Jacobs. Bolden has been a special teams guy nearly his entire career, so I doubt he carves out any legitimate role on offense. Abdullah has been used as a third-down back on the several teams he has been on at the NFL level, but I am not ready to declare him as a huge threat to Jacobs' workload. Sure he might work in some, but not enough to hurt Jacobs' bottom-line value. The team also drafted Zamir White in the fourth round, but I would not expect much from White in year one based on Josh McDaniels' track record from New England of not featuring Day 3 rookie RBs. The new head coach is more likely to run Jacobs into the ground on an expiring contract as he did with Dion Lewis, LeGarrette Blount and Shane Vereen during his Patriots tenure. And besides, the red-zone role is the most significant for fantasy points, and that looks to be clearly in Jacobs' grasp. Two-down back Damien Harris was in the red-zone role for the Patriots last season and flourished because of it. He ranked fourth in carries (46) and third in rushing TDs (13) from inside the 20-yard line.",170.01,172,21,36,24.9,47,83,61.6,3.3,19,33,25.8,3.5,

The poor rushing efficiency is bearable, but the poor receiving usage is hard to ignore. Especially considering his calling card out of LSU was catching balls out of the backfield. His 0.73 yards per route run ranked 64th out of 68 qualifying running backs - also significantly worse than his teammates Darrel Williams (1.28) and Jerick McKinnon (1.15). Some may also feel that the Ronald Jones addition is the final nail in the coffin for CEH, but it's not that black and white.

It's actually a positive sign for Edwards-Helaire that the team brought in Jones instead of re-signing McKinnon or Williams.

I'd presume that Edwards-Helaire will fully take over the primary pass-catching role - which was the reason why the Chiefs drafted him in the 1st round in any way - while also working in tandem with Jones as a rusher on early downs.

Many will point to Gore's undrafted status as a reason to believe he won't be a factor in 2022. But the team's belief in fellow UDFA Williams suggests that the team won't shy away from Gore if he is indeed the best option for the job. He was superior to both Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Ronald Jones last season in PFF rushing grade and yards after contact per attempt. Gore was also uber-efficient in the passing game, finishing fourth in the NFL in yards per route run.

He just happened to be overshadowed by Ohio State transfer Jameson Williams. But don't sleep on Metchie because he possesses a nice skillset that will translate well with the Texans. He's a savvy route runner that understands how to get leverage and create separation from defenders. His game reminds me of Eddie Royal. He probably won't ever be a true No. 1, but that doesn't preclude him from carving out a niche role starting from the slot. But that will have to wait until 2023.

It's a strong indicator that Smith will likely crack the final 53-man roster, and his special-teams ability will be his pathway to being active on game day. Just dressing for games is half the battle for many rookies, so for Smith to have a realistic path as a UDFA should not be ignored. And neither should the general ambiguity surrounding Alvin Kamara's legal matters after he was arrested in Las Vegas during the Pro Bowl. If Kamara is suspended for any allotment of time, Smith is looking at a depth chart composed of Mark Ingram, Tony Jones Jr., Dwayne Washington, and Devine Ozigbo. Ingram just turned 32. Jones was a UDFA in 2020 and bombed in his lone start in 2021. Washington has been on the roster for four seasons and has totaled 47 carries. It's not far-fetched to think that Smith is going to have a role on an ascending Saints offense sooner rather than later. He would hardly be the first UDFA success story to come out of New Orleans ie. Khiry Robinson, Chris Ivory, and Pierre Thomas.",,0,80,118,103.8,296,378,337,11.5,130,151,143.7,9.7,
